					<div id="about">
Harvey Jackson Curtis was born on January 20, 1876 in Argos, Indiana. His early career<br>
was centered in Marshall County, Indiana-he was Superintendent of schools in Tyner for <br>
four years, was admitted to the bar in nearby Plymouth in 1901, and began practicing in <br>
Walkerton. He graduated from the University Of Michigan Law School in 1903. <br><br>

In 1908, Judge Curtis moved to the new city of Gary. In 1910, he was appointed Garyâ€™s <br>
first city attorney. <br><br>

He was elected to the Indiana Appellate Court in 1930 and served from January 1, 1931 <br>
until January 1, 1943. He was Chief Judge four different times-for the November 1932, <br>
November 1935, November 1938 and November 1940 court terms. <br><br>

Following his service on the bench, he was chairman of the board of Mid- City investment <br>
Company in Gray and occasionally heard cases involving labor disputes as a hearing Judge. <br>
Judge Curtis was a member of the American and Indiana State bar associations, as well as <br>
the Gary Bar Association from its earliest days. He belonged to the Episcopal Church of <br>
Gary, the Elks Club, and the masons. <br><br>

He died at his home in Orlando Florida on December 27, 1954.
