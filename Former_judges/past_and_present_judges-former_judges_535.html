					<div id="about">
James C, Cooper graduated from Technical High School Indianapolis. He received his <br>
law degree from the Benjamin Harrison Law School and the Indiana University School of <br>
Law. <br><br>

Judge Cooper was Rushville Prosecutor from 1940 to 1947. He was appointed the <br>
State public Defender on October 15, 1947, a post he held for 11 years. During his tenure,<br>
he was named Outstanding Public Defender of the United States. <br><br>

Judge Cooper, a Rushville Republican, was first elected to the Indiana Appellate Court in <br>
1956 and re-elected in 1960. He served from 1957 to 1964 and again from 1967 to 1970. <br>
He was Chief Judge during the November 1958 and November 1962 terms. In 1964, Judge <br>
Cooper ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Indiana Supreme Court. <br><br>

At the time of his death, Judge Cooper was most known as the author of a landmark 1968 <br>
appellate decision on gubernatorial powers. Metropolitan transit Authority v. State of <br>
Indiana stated that a governor does not have pocket veto power over bills passed by the <br>
Indiana General Assembly. <br><br>

Judge Cooper was a member of the Murat Temple (Masons), the Tall Cedars of Lebanon <br>
and a past governor of the Moose Lodge.<br><br>

He died in office on September 13, 1970 at the age of 67. He was survived by a son, <br>
