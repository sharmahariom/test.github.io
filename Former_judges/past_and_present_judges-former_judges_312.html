member of the Mystic Shrine, an odd Fellow, a Knight of Pythias, and a Red Man, a member<br>
of the Commercial Club, the Indiana Club, the University Club the Century Club, and a <br>
prominent member of the first Presbyterian Church,” He served a term as president of the<br>
Indiana State Bar Association after several terms as treasure, and was a member of the<br>
American Bar Association. From April 1906 until his death on April 25, 1907 he was also <br>
chairman of the Marion County Democratic Committee.<br><br>

News accounts reported he died of “Bright’s disease and hardening of the arteries”. He was <br>
survived by his wife Anna, and their three children, Helen, Gray, and Paul. Paul entered into<br>
law practice with his father’s partner, Judge Frank Gavin.<br>
