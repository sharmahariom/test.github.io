					<div id="about"> 
Charles Haddon Bedwell was born on March 18, 1884 in Dugger, Sullivan County. He <br>
received a bachelors degree from Central Normal College in Danville and taught school in<br>
Sullivan County before earning a law degree from Indiana University in 1907. He practiced <br>
in Sullivan County, specializing in labor law. <br> 
in 1912, he ran as a Democrat for the Indiana House of Representatives and was elected, <br>
serving during the 1913 and 1915 sessions. He was Speaker during the 1915 session. He <br>
