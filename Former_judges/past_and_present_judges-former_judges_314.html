					<div id="about">
George E, Ross was born January 15, 1858. He attended public schools in Peru, Indiana <br>
before Wabash College in Crawfordsville. In 1878 he gained admission to the Bar from Cass<br>
County and practiced with his father, Nathan O. Ross. <br><br>

Judge Ross won a seat on the Indiana Appellate Court as a Democrat, and served one term<br>
from January 1, 1893 to January 1, 1897. He returned to Cass County to practice law with his<br>
father, until Nathan Ross passed away in July 1901.<br><br>

In 1901, Judge Ross became counsel to the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis<br>
Railway Company, which later became the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. In this position,<br>
which he held until his death, he regularly argued cases before the Indiana  Appellate Court<br>
and Indiana Supreme Court. <br><br>

He died on June 27, 1928 while on vacation in La Jolla California.<br>
