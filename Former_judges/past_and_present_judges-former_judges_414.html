moved to Steuben County, Indiana. He attended high school in Angola for one year, then <br>
became a schoolteacher himself, as well as a carpenter. In his leisure time, he read borrowed<br>
law books and studied law under Robert W. McBride, who would later become a judge of the <br>
Indiana Supreme Court. Judge Roby was admitted to the bar in 1876 and began practicing<br>

was also granted another Judge , and on March 21, 1901, governor Winfield Durbin appointed<br>
Judge Roby to the Appellate Court as the sixth judge, A Republican, he was elected to the<br>
court in 1902 and 1906; he served as Chief Judge four different times-for the November <br>
1902, November 1905, November 1907 and November 1910 terms. <br><br>

In 1911, when he left the bench, he practiced law in Indianapolis with W.H. Watson and <br>
