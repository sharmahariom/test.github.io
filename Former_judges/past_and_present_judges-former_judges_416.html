Joseph Rabb was born in Covington, Fountain County, Indiana on <br>
February 14, 1846. The Civil War began when he was still a teenager,<br>
and he enlisted in the 6th Indiana Calvary Regiment in the Union Army. <br>
His unit saw action mostly in Tennessee and Georgia, particularly the <br>
Battles of Kennesaw Mountain, Atlanta, and Nashville in 1864. Judge <br>
Rabb was mustered out of service following the end of the war in 1865.<br>
He returned home to Indiana, studied law, and was admitted to the bar <br>
In Warren County in 1867. He began practicing in Williamsport. He<br>
served 24 years as Judge of the Twenty-First judicial Circuit. In 1906,<br>
he was elected as a Republican to the Indiana Appellate Court and <br>
served one term, from January 1, 1907 to January 1911. Following <br>
his service on the court, Judge Rabb moved to Logansport to establish <br>
a law practice with M.F.  Mahoney. Throughout his professional life, he <br>
remained active in Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) activities. He <br>
died at home in Logansport on April 29, 1925
