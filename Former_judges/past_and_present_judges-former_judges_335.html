He taught school for three years, and then served in the United States Navy during World War I. Following<br>
The war, he received his law degree at Northwestern University and began practicing law in Evansville<br>
In 1921.<br><br>

He was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1924 and 1926 and to the Indiana Senate<br>
