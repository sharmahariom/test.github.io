					<div id="about"> 

Jeptha  Dudley New was born in Vernon, Jennings County, Indiana in 1830 and resided there nearly<br>
all of his life. He attended Vernon Seminary in his hometown and studied under Disciples of Christ<br>
founder Alexander Campbell of Bethany College in West Virginia. Following his graduation in 1850,<br>
he spent two years teaching school and studying law, first in the Indianapolis office of Horatio C.<br>
Newcomb, and then the office of Lucius Bingham in Vernon.<br><br>

In 1856, Judge New entered the private practice of law in Franklin, Johnson County, with Thomas W.<br>
Woollen, who would later serve as attorney General of Indiana. Less than a year later he returned to<br>
Vernon to open his own law practice and many Sallie Butler, with whom he would father three children.<br><br>

In 1862 Judge New was elected prosecuting attorney and served for two years before being elected<br>
Judge of the common pleas court for Jennings, Jackson Bartholomew and Lawrence counties.<br>
Judge New was twice elected to the U.S House of Representatives as a Democrat, serving non-<br>
consecutive terms from 1875 to 1877 and from 1879 to 1881. He declined his partyâ€™s nomination for<br>
the 1877 term. Following his second term, he returned to Vernon to practice law and in 1882 was <br>
elected circuit judge for Jennings, Ripley and Scott counties.<br><br>

In 1889, the Indiana general Assembly named Judge New to a re-constituted Supreme Court<br>
Commission, but he did not serve because the Supreme Court declared the commission<br>
unconstitutional. In 1891, the general Assembly passed a statute creating a temporary Appellate<br>
Court, and governor Alvin p. Hovey appointed Judge New to the court to represent the Second District. The following year, <br> 
his fellow Democrats nominated him for a seat on the Sopreme Court.Judge New died before being elected to the Supreme Court <br>
from a self-inflicted pistol, shot at home in Vernon July 9, 1892. His son Willard succeeded him on the Appellate Court.
