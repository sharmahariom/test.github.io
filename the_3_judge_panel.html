					<p> THE 3-JUDGE PANELS</p>
				</div>	
				
				<div id="welcome-text">
					<p id="welcome-text-p"> 
					 The court considers cases in three-judge panels that have <br>
					 statewide jurisdiction and rotate three times per year. The <br>
					 three-judge panel system has been in effect in Indiana since <br>
					 1972 and is consistent with the standard adopted by the <br>
					 American Bar Association. Since 1998, the three-judge <br>
					 panels have been formed according to a mathematical <br>
					 formula ("Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem Solution"¬ù) that allows <br>
					 randomly assigned panels of diverse membership. <br><br>
					 
					 The underlying rationale for panels of three is that cases <br>
					 should be resolved by a collective judicial judgment so that <br>
					 appeals are more than substituting the decision of a single <br>
					 appellate judge for that of a single trial judge. <br><br>
					 
					 There is no deadline for the court to reach its decisions; <br>
					 however, the court strives to issue decisions within four <br>
					 months of receiving an appeal, and often issues decisions <br>
					 before the self-imposed deadline. <br><br>
