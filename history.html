					The concept of a second appellate-level court to serve the entire State of Indiana<br>
					originated with an enactment of the Indiana General Assembly in 1891. The<br>
					Appellate Court of Indiana was created to relieve the growing caseload of the<br>
					Indiana Supreme Court; it was intended to exist as a judicial panel for six years to <br>
					expedite an overflow of appellate cases. In 1897, the court was retained for an <br>
					additional four years.  In 1901, the court was made the permanent Appellate Court, <br>
					which evolved into an eight-member court that sat in panels comprised of four <br>
					judges. Eventually, the eight-member Appellate Court was abolished and today's <br>
					Court of Appeals of Indiana was created as a constitutional court by an <br>
					amendment to the Indiana Constitution ratified on November 3, 1970.  The court <br>
					came into existence on January 1, 1972. <br><br>
