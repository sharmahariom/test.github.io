					<p id="inner-content-2"> 
					
					Senior judges are experienced members of the Court of Appeals, and with their <br>
					accumulated insight and wisdom, they are a valuable resource. The court uses <br>
					their expertise to help reduce caseload burdens. <br>
					Court of Appeals judges must retire at age 75. Retired judges may seek senior judge <br>
					status and are required to work at least 30 days per year. <br>
					Senior judges are assigned every 16th case from the civil, criminal, and expedited <br>
					case rotations. They serve on three-judge panels and on the court's motions panel. <br> <br>
