					The Court of Appeals of Indiana considers appeals from the state's trial courts<br>
					and selected administrative agencies. The Court of Appeals comprises of 15 judges <br>
					and senior judges, from the entire state. (Senior judges may also serve the court.) <br>
					Sitting in three-judge panels, they review trial court and state agency records <br> 
					and usually answer a specific legal question or questions raised in the initial <br>
					trial or by the trial court's decision.<br><br>
					
					The 15 members of the court issued more than 1,900 written opinions (decisions)<br>
					in 2015.  A Court of Appeals opinion is final unless granted further review <br>
					by the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals does not preside over trials <br>
					and must accept all appeals as of right except those automatically sent to the <br>
					Indiana Supreme Court or the Indiana Tax Court. <br> <br>
					
					Appeals from cases in which the sentence is the death penalty or life without<br>
					parole, appeals from trial court decisions finding a statute unconstitutional, <br>
					and attorney discipline cases are sent directly to the Indiana Supreme Court.   <br><br>
					
					All opinions are available on the court's website.
